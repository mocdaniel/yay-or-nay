# Features in Yay or Nay

Yay Or Nay comes with a handful of features. They are described below.

---

## Creation of Custom Codes for Feedback Forms

Folks at conferences are sometimes hesitant to 'just scan' QR Codes. To make feedback forms easily accessible, it is thus
possible to create **custom, 8-letter codes** to access feedback forms **from the front page** or via **permalink**.

If no custom code is provided at time of feedback form creation, a random code will be generated.

## Creation of Feedback Forms for Multiple Presentation Types

Yay Or Nay supports creating feedback forms for multiple presentation types.
There will always be four questions in the feedback form, along with input fields
for additional, _optional_ information:

- Name
- Email
- Comments
- Consent to the feedback being published

Read more about the available feedback form types in the [Feedback Forms](./feedback-forms/panels.md) section.

## Creation of QR Codes for Feedback Forms

Once a feedback form has been created, a **QR Code** can be generated and downloaded from the **admin dashboard**.

This QR Code is _not_ customizable at the moment - if you need to apply specific styling, use the fixed permalink and an
external QR Code generator instead.

---

## (De-)Activation of Feedback Forms

It is possible to **toggle** feedback forms from an _active_ to an _inactive_ state and back. Thus, forms can be reused
on multiple occasions, or you can make sure that feedback gets collected only shortly after the presentation took place.

## Inspecting Gathered Feedback

The **Detail View** of each created feedback form, available from the admin dashboard, holds the gathered feedback
from respondees.

The view features a **high-level breakdown** of all responses for the respective feedback form, as well as a listing
of all individual responses, along with _comments, names, emails_, and an _indicator_ whether or not the feedback may be
published in the future.

A feature to publish select feedback in the future in a guestbook-like style is
[on the project's roadmap](https://github.com/mocdaniel/yay-or-nay/projects).
