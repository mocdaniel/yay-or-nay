Yay Or Nay supports creating feedback forms for **Workshops**, i.e. medium- to long-form presentations, often hands-on,
on a specific topic.

## Creating Panel Feedback Forms

You can create a new feedback form for workshops from the dashboard.

Click on **Create Form**, and choose **Workshop** from the _Type_ dropdown menu.

## Available Questions

The questions being asked to respondees are listed below, along with their follow-up questions given for context
and inspiration:

1. **How would you rate the overall topic?**

    _Was it relevant to you? Did it fit the occasion?_

2. **How would you rate the presenter's expertise?**

    _Did they seem knowledgeable? Did they seem prepared?_

3. **How would you rate the workshop materials?**

    _Did they provide enough information? Were they easy to follow?_

4. **How would you rate the interactive parts of the workshop?**
   
    _Were they engaging? Were they too easy or too hard?_

All questions can be graded on a **scale of 1-5**.
